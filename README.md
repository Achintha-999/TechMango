## About

TechMango is a project scaffold and template repository designed to help developers onboard quickly and understand the structure and behavior of the application. This README provides all required steps to install, configure, and run the project locally, plus guidance for contributing and deploying.

## Features

- ✨ Clean and friendly README with badges and icons
- 🧩 Modular architecture (frontend, backend, database)
- 🛠️ Clear setup and development instructions
- ✅ Testing and CI guidance

## Tech Stack

> Note: Replace the below tech stack with the actual technologies used by TechMango if different.

- Frontend: React / Vue / Svelte (replace as appropriate) 
- Backend: Node.js (Express / Nest) or Python (Django / Flask)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite
- Auth: JWT / OAuth2
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Operating System: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Node.js: >= 16.x (if the project uses Node) — install from https://nodejs.org/
- npm or yarn: latest stable
- Python: >= 3.8 (if backend is Python-based)
- pip: latest (for Python projects)
- Docker & Docker Compose: optional but recommended for isolated local development
- Git: installed and configured

## Installation

These instructions cover the most common scenarios — update according to your mono-repo or multi-service setup.

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Achintha-999/TechMango.git
   cd TechMango
   ```

2. Inspect the repository root to find the stack

   - If you have a package.json: it's a Node.js project
   - If you have requirements.txt, Pipfile, or pyproject.toml: it's a Python project
   - If you have a frontend/ or client/ folder and a server/ or api/ folder: it's likely a full-stack monorepo

3a. Node.js setup (example)

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install # or yarn
   npm run dev

   cd ../backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3b. Python setup (example)

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3c. Docker (recommended for consistency)

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

## Configuration

Create a .env file in the project root (or in each service folder) using the provided .env.example. Typical environment variables:

```dotenv
# .env.example
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/techmango_db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## How it works

This section explains the high-level architecture of TechMango. Adapt to the actual implementation.

- Client (frontend)
  - Handles user interface, routing, and client-side state
  - Communicates with backend via REST or GraphQL

- Server (backend)
  - Exposes API endpoints for authentication, data access, and business logic
  - Validates requests, enforces auth, and persists data to the database

- Database
  - Stores application data (users, records, metadata)
  - Typically PostgreSQL in production, SQLite or Dockerized PostgreSQL locally

- Background workers (optional)
  - Perform long-running jobs (email, processing, scheduled tasks) using Redis + worker queue (e.g., Bull, RQ, Celery)

- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions build, run tests, lint, and deploy to hosting (VPS, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, or cloud provider)

## Usage

Start the development environment (example):

- Node monolith

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

- Full-stack monorepo (example)

   ```bash
   git clone ...
   # frontend
   cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
   # backend
   cd ../backend && npm install && npm run dev
   ```

## Running tests

Run unit and integration tests using the project's test runner:

```bash
npm test
# or
pytest
```

## Linting & formatting

Use ESLint / Prettier or Flake8 / Black depending on the stack.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Deployment

A common Docker + GitHub Actions flow:

1. Push to main or release branch
2. GitHub Actions builds and runs tests
3. If checks pass, build Docker images and push to registry
4. Deploy to production environment (kubernetes, Heroku, etc.)

## Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute! Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/short-description
3. Commit your changes with clear messages
4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against main
5. Add tests and update documentation as needed

Please respect the code style in the repo and run linters locally before pushing.
